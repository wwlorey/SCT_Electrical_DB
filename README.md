CS2300 Introduction to Database Systems class project | S&T Solar Car Team Electrical Database

The data is stored in a mySQL database and PHP along with HTML and Javascript are used to interface with it and handle user interaction. This software will be used by the [S&T Solar Car Team](https://solarcar.mst.edu/) to catalog electrical components, team member information, systems on the car, and cars themselves.

The application is currently hosted [here](http://solar.williamlorey.com).

Designed and implemented by M. Jacob Schoonover, Ruicheng Xu, and William Lorey.
